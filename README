hackMatch
=========

hackMatch is an open-source matching algorithm. It accepts two sets of text and finds the best matches between each.

For example, at hackNY.org we use hackMatch to match students with appropriate internship opportunities.

This script is open source, and patches are welcome.

============
Dependencies
============

hackMatch uses NLTK (nltk.org) and hcluster (for distance metrics).

To install the dependencies, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.

After installing nltk, you need to get the stopwords corpus. Run download_stopwords.py at the command line:

	$ python download_stopwords.py
	[nltk_data] Downloading package 'stopwords' to
	[nltk_data]     /home/hbrown/nltk_data...
	[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/stopwords.zip.
	True
	$
